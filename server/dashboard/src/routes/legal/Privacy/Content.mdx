# OpenPin.Center Privacy Policy

_Effective Date: 26 May 2025_

---

## 1. Introduction

OpenPin.Center ("**Service**", "**we**", "**our**", or "**us**") is a hosted version of the open-source **OpenPin** backend that enables owners of Humane AI Pins to continue using their devices. This policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, the choices you have, and the steps we take to protect it.

OpenPin.Center is operated by **Max Maeder**. If you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, please do not use the Service.

---

## 2. Information We Collect

We collect only the information needed to operate, secure, and improve the Service:

**Account information.** When you create an account you provide an email address. We store this so you can sign in, reset your password, and receive important notifications.

**Conversation data.** When you talk to your Humane AI Pin through OpenPin.Center, your speech is transcribed by a third-party speech-to-text provider. We store **only the resulting text** so you can review your history and so we can debug and enhance the Service. We **never** keep copies of the raw audio.

**Usage & device data.** Like most online services, we log limited technical details—IP address, browser or firmware version, timestamps, and request metadata—to protect the Service, enforce usage limits, and compile aggregated statistics.

We do **not** intentionally collect payment information, government IDs, or special-category (sensitive) data. Please avoid including such information in your prompts.

## 3. How We Use Information How We Use Information

1. **Provide & maintain the Service** (process prompts, return responses, enforce usage limits).
2. **Improve & debug** our models and infrastructure.
3. **Communicate** with you about updates, security alerts, or support.
4. **Comply** with legal obligations and resolve disputes.

We rely on at least one of the following lawful bases: performance of a contract, legitimate interest, and your consent where required (e.g., marketing emails).

---

## 4. Data Retention & Deletion

- Conversation data and usage logs are retained for **30 days by default** to enable history and quality improvements.
- You may **delete conversation history at any time** from the web interface.
- To close your entire account and erase all associated data, email **[max@mmaeder.com](mailto:max@mmaeder.com)** from your registered address. Permanent deletion occurs within **30 days** unless legal retention obligations apply.

---

## 5. Sharing & Disclosure

We never sell your personal data. We share it only:

- **With third-party processors** that help us run the Service—e.g., cloud hosting, Google Maps, or large-language-model providers—strictly under contractual data-protection terms.
- **If required by law** or to protect the rights, property, or safety of OpenPin.Center, our users, or the public.

> **Voice data** is transmitted **directly** from your device to these processors for tasks such as speech recognition. **We do not store copies of raw audio.**

## 6. Security

We employ industry-standard security measures (encryption in transit & at rest, least-privilege access, monitoring). No method is 100 % secure, so we cannot guarantee absolute security.

---

## 7. Your Rights

Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have rights to access, rectify, erase, or port your personal data, object to processing, or lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority. Contact **[max@mmaeder.com](mailto:max@mmaeder.com)** to exercise these rights.

---

## 8. Children's Privacy

The Service is **not directed to children under 13** (or higher age required by local law). We do not knowingly collect data from children. If you believe a child has provided us data, contact us for deletion.

---

## 9. International Transfers

We operate globally; therefore your data may be processed outside your jurisdiction, including in the United States. We use appropriate safeguards (e.g., Standard Contractual Clauses) where required.

---

## 10. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Material changes will be posted on this page and, if significant, notified via email or in-Service notices. Continued use after changes constitutes acceptance.
